    Parents play the biggest role in our development.
    Father and mother play important role in our mental, physical, social, 
    financial and career development.
    Parents are the most precious gift of God for us, They help us in every step of our life,
    they trained us very hard style 
    for the future challenges.Parents are living for us,
    Parent protect their children from harm,Parent provide good food,clothing and home to live they provide medical care
    and good education.
    they are real God and first teacher,
    really parenting a child is not easy but our parents are doing it very smoothly.
    The proper role of the parent is to provide encouragement, support,
     and access to activities that enable the child to master key developmental tasks. 
    A child's learning and socialization are most influenced by 
    their family since the family is the child's primary social group and
    Parents have a lasting impact on children's learning. ...
     Research shows that when parents are involved in their children's education, 
    children are more engaged with their school work, stay in school longer,
     and achieve better learning outcomes. 
    This also translates into longer-term economic and social benefits.
    Parents are the ones who provide unconditional love to the child in life.
    Parents are the only people where a child can feel more safety and protection.
    without parent our life is unfullfilled
    parents can do anything for their childs bright future.
    No one can love us like our parent. 
    we should respect them and their decisions in life.
