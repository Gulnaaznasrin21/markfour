       <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">I wanted to share a little of experience with building the front end and back end.  I enjoy front-end more after doing NEOG projects.

        If I were to do plain JavaScript and HTML CSS, I would probably prefer the back-end. 
        Learning Python was great in terms of understanding JavaScript better.
         When I started learning React,
         that was when I thought I could see the front-end being fun. If I will get opportunity 
         I would want it to be in React. If it were any other language,
          I would probably prefer the back end.
        It really helped with impostor syndrome.
         Because I had this background in Mathematics, 
         I already understood the user and the product. 
         I am enjoying the projects of NEOGS.
        Its great opportunity to learn more and more about front-end with react.
        Its sad to share that According to a global software developer survey in 2021,
         the vast majority of developers are the male gender,
        accounting for 91.67 percent of all respondents.        
        Female developers amounted to only 5.31 percent of all respondents.
        Developers are in high demand within the tech industry, however, women 
        only make up 11% of the developer workforce my wish is to increase the percentage of women developer.
        I am proud of myself Because I am a Female developer.
