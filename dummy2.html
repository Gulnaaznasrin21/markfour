       <p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">I wanted to share a little of experience with building the front end and back end.  I enjoy front-end more after doing NEOG projects.

        If I were to do plain JavaScript and HTML CSS, I would probably prefer the back-end. Learning Python was great in terms of understanding JavaScript better. When I started learning React, that was when I thought I could see the front-end being fun. A job in the front-end, I would want it to be in React. If it were any other language, I would probably prefer the back end.

        It really helped with impostor syndrome. Because I had this background in Mathematics, I already understood the user and the product. I am enjoying the projects of NEOGS. Its great opportunity to learn more and more about front-end with react.
